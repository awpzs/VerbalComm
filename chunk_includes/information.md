1.  **Research Project Title: Referential communication**

2.  **Background, aims of project**

    You're invited to take part in a study investigating how speakers achieve successful communication verbally (without using gesture). We hope this will enhance our understanding of the processes that underlie language communication.

3.  **Why have I been invited to take part?**

    You have been asked to participate because we want to understand how native speakers of Mandarin Chinese, who are monolingual and non-dyslexic, and are aged less than 30 years old, achieve referential communication.

4.  **Do I have to take part?**

    No, you don't have to take part, and participation in this study is voluntary. You may withdraw from this study at any time without giving a reason and without getting any penalty. You can keep this information sheet by saving it to your own device, and you will be asked to sign a consent form.
