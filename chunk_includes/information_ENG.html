<li><p><strong>Research Project Title: Referential communication</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Background, aims of project</strong></p>
<p>You’re invited to take part in a study investigating how speakers achieve successful communication verbally (without using gesture). We hope this will enhance our understanding of the processes that underlie language communication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why have I been invited to take part?</strong></p>
<p>You have been asked to participate because we want to understand how native speakers of Mandarin Chinese, who are non-dyslexic, and are aged less than 30 years old, achieve referential communication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do I have to take part?</strong></p>
<p>No, you are not bounded to take part, and participation in this study is voluntary. You may withdraw from this study at any time without giving a reason and without getting any penalty. You can keep this information sheet by saving it to your own device, and you will be asked to sign a consent form.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What will happen if I take part?</strong></p>
<p>You will be asked to describe the locations of objects as displayed in pictures. The experiment takes place online and should take approximately 30 minutes. No follow up visits are required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there any potential risks in taking part?</strong></p>
<p>There is no known risk involved in this study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are there any benefits in taking part?</strong></p>
<p>You will receive £7 for taking part. Please note that you will only receive the payment after you have completed the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What happens to the data I provide? </strong></p>
<p>The research data will be anonymised and only the research team will have access to personal information (namely, your gender, age, and language background).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Will the research be published?</strong></p>
<p>The findings from this research will be published in journals and conference proceedings. You will not be identifiable in any report or publication. The University of Stirling is committed to making the outputs of research publicly accessible and supports this commitment through our online open access repository STORRE. Unless publisher requirements prevent us this research will be publicly disseminated through our open access repository.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Who has reviewed this research project?</strong></p>
<p>This project has been ethically approved via The University of Stirling General University Ethics Panel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Who do I contact if I have concerns about this study or I wish to complain?</strong></p>
